# Data Science Links
My Personal Collection of Data Science Resources and related areas. From known to unknown and as much as needed in between. The contents of this repository are at the moments links to documentation and articles that I have found relevant in my quest to learn and document descriptions of relevant tools and concepts.

I will update this with resources as I go with no particular order but the reading order. Thus, some sections will remain blank for a while.
